## First Interview

*Reminder: Grade your partner throughout the interview*
#### JavaScript Problem
https://repl.it/GN0C/3
NB: Ignore the modal that tells you to sign up

** No external resources/Googling allowed for this problem! **

#### Frontend Problem
https://jsfiddle.net/
Render a button on JSFiddle that moves to a new random location whenever it is clicked.

** For first 10 minutes, no outside resources allowed. After 10 minutes, interviewee may use Google. **

#### Personal Pitch
Tell me about yourself.

#### Behavioral
If I were to ask your last boss (or professor) to describe you, what would they say?

NB: A good answer to the above question would include a succinct example (especially if done in PAR format)!
